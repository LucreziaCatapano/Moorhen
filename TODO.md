A JavaScript molecular graphics program

### For 0.14.2
- [ ] Print out molecule info - B-factors, etc. This could be hover info, atom label, full print

- [ ] Small molecule CIF loading via UI
- [ ] "Somehow" determine PLDDT vs B-factor in SliceNDice

### Todo
- [ ] Highlight things other than balls.
- [ ] Auto scaled shadow box
- [ ] Lipid cartoons
- [ ] Images/Legends
- [ ] Prosmart (this is complicated because of the subprocess model).
- [ ] Generate Helices
- [ ] Normal modes
    - [ ] Experimental vs. Theoretical B-values
    - [ ] Cross correlation plot
    - [ ] List normal modes
    - [ ] Animate normal modes
