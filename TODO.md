# Moorhen
A JavaScript molecular graphics program

### For 0.14.2
- [ ] Print out molecule info - B-factors, etc. This could be hover info, atom label, full print
      of ATOM cards, context menu option. Environment of temp factors.
- [x] Display SMILES string for ligand.
- [ ] Undo button on a molecule loaded from SMILES/PubChem with name > 3 letters breaks the structure.
- [x] Small molecule CIF loading via UI
- [ ] "Somehow" determine PLDDT vs B-factor in SliceNDice
- [x] 1dp4 biomolecule may not be correct.
- [ ] Add Zoom to "Show controls"

### Todo
- [ ] Coloured sequences: https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/nightingale/#/coloured-sequence
- [ ] Sequence alignments: https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/nightingale/#/msa
- [ ] Secondary structure annotation and other kinds of annotation: https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/nightingale/#/track
- [ ] Highlight things other than balls.
- [ ] Auto scaled shadow box
- [ ] Lipid cartoons
- [ ] Images/Legends
- [ ] Prosmart (this is complicated because of the subprocess model).
- [ ] Generate Helices
- [ ] Normal modes
    - [ ] Experimental vs. Theoretical B-values
    - [ ] Cross correlation plot
    - [ ] List normal modes
    - [ ] Animate normal modes
